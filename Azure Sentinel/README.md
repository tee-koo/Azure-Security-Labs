# Project Overview – Azure Sentinel SIEM with Terraform & KQL  

This project demonstrates how to detect brute-force login attempts in Azure Active Directory using Microsoft Sentinel.  
The alert rule is provisioned via Terraform and custom KQL query that analyzes failed sign-in events.  
A Sentinel playbook is also included to automate response actions such as sending notifications.
