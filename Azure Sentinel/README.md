This project demonstrates how to detect brute-force login attempts in Azure Active Directory using Microsoft Sentinel.  
The alert rule is provisioned via Terraform and custom KQL query that analyzes failed sign-in events.  
A Sentinel playbook is also included to automate response actions such as sending notifications.  

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -var="subscription_id=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)" -out deploy.plan
terraform apply deploy.plan
